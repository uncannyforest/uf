I'm rewriting the website in React with an Express/Postgres backend.  It was originally in Rails.

To run locally for development:
```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm run start
```

These last two commands should be run in separate terminals.

To run for production:
```bash
npm i
npm run build-prod
npm run start-prod
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.
